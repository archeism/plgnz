# Publishing plgnz

Set up npm Trusted Publishing for the `plgnz` package with these exact GitHub Actions fields: repository owner `archeism`, repository name `plgnz`, workflow filename `publish.yml`, and no environment. In **Allowed actions**, enable direct **`npm publish`**; newly created connections default to staging permission only. See [npm Trusted Publishing setup](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers/).

The workflow uses GitHub's OIDC identity; no npm token or repository secret is needed. GitHub-hosted Actions runners are free for public repositories.

For each release, bump `package.json` to the next `0.0.x` patch version, run the local tests and checks, and inspect `npm pack --dry-run --ignore-scripts`. Push the reviewed change to `main`, then manually run **Publish to npm** from GitHub Actions on `main` with that exact version. The workflow checks the version and branch before publishing. Running it is the separate authorization to release; adding this workflow does not publish anything.

The published CLI currently requires Bun on the user's PATH. This workflow packages the existing source and does not build a standalone Node executable.
